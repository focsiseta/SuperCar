# SuperCar
Project for my Computer Graphics exam.
This was a really fun project and to be quite honest, with this project I discovered
a field of CS I fell in love with. I still have so much to learn, I can't wait.

Now about the project itself, it's written in native WebGL and pure Javascript.
The code could be more javascript-y, but for the love of myself I stayed away from all the weird stuff that can be done with JS.

Importing 3D models was quite a breeze when they were simple models, thanks to Meshlab (meshlab.net) I was able to convert most of them in JSON.


# Car controls

WASD for movement of the car

    W for acceleration 
    A/D for going left or right
    S for the slowest retro ever
    
    Q/P front "lights" on/off <-- they work even in mouse mode

Keep pressed M for mouse mode
    

    In this mode you will be able to drag the scene (while leftclicking) with your mouse 
    and move where the chase-camera is facing. While in this mode you can also rotate camera position using A and D

Thanks to my professor, archivetextures.net and humus.net for providing some of the textures I use in this project.
